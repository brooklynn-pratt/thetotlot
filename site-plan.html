      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>My idea for the website would be a place to help small childcare businesses. This website would basically be a big folder that makes it super simple to figure out certain kids’ allergies and preferences to foods and other things. Teachers would be able to add different categories to their class, one for different food allergies, one for medications, and another for alternative activities or meals for kids that may not get to participate</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Teachers and parents who have kids in daycares</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Color Palette

      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
